# Analyses-of-Intellectual-Property-on-Instagram-and-Facebook

  Facewbook is committed to helping people and organizations protect their IP rights and do not allow people to post content that violates someone elseâ€™s IP rights.

  The data that I used (it can be founf [here] (https://transparency.fb.com/data/intellectual-property/protecting-intellectual-property-rights) shows that from 2017 to 2020, the vast majority of content the operation team of FB took action on for potential counterfeit or copyright-related violations was removed proactively. The data contains how many reports of IP violations is received and how much content is taken down on as a result. The report also includes how much content FB tooks down proactively for IP violations.

## H reports
  Facebook's IP protection measures begin with the Terms of Service and our Community Standards, which prohibit people from posting content that infringes others' IP rights. Similar provisions are included in Instagram's Terms of Use and Community Guidelines. Under our policies, rights holders can submit IP reports identifying content on Facebook and Instagram that they believe infringes their rights. If a report is complete and valid, BF will act promptly to remove the reported content.

  This report includes the following IP reports:
## Copyright
  Copyright is a legal right that seeks to protect original works of authorship (ex: books, music, film, art). Generally, copyright protects original expression such as words or images, but copyright typically does not prohibit fair uses of an author's expression, such as a parody.
## Trademark
  A trademark is a word, slogan, symbol or design (for example, a brand name or logo) that distinguishes the products or services offered by one person from another. Generally, trademark law seeks to prevent confusion among consumers about the source of a product or service. But using a trademark for the purpose of discussing the goods offered, such as to criticize them, does not typically constitute infringement.
## Counterfeits
  A counterfeit good is a knock-off or replica version of another company's product. It usually copies the trademarked name, logo, and/or distinctive features of that other company's product to imitate a genuine product. Manufacture, promotion, or sale of counterfeits is a type of trademark infringement.

## My goal 
  I explore a real data set "IP Protection on Facebook and Instagram". I begin the notebook with some exploratory data analysis and use the data to build a prediction of infringements for next years. I am going to include here time series ananlysis, since it is an important factor to consider in a model when I wish to predict infringements and its trends, seasonality, stationary.
