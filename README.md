Facebook, a social networking site, is used for exchanging information, ideas, marketing and selling products. 

We are committed to helping people and organizations protect their IP rights. We do not allow people to post content that violates someone elseâ€™s IP rights.

This report details how many reports of IP violations we received and how much content we took down on as a result. The report also includes how much content we took down proactively for IP violations.

H2 2020 report
Facebook's IP protection measures begin with our Terms of Service and our Community Standards, which prohibit people from posting content that infringes others' IP rights. Similar provisions are included in Instagram's Terms of Use and Community Guidelines. Under our policies, rights holders can submit IP reports identifying content on Facebook and Instagram that they believe infringes their rights. If a report is complete and valid, we will act promptly to remove the reported content.

This report includes the following IP reports:
Copyright
Copyright is a legal right that seeks to protect original works of authorship (ex: books, music, film, art). Generally, copyright protects original expression such as words or images, but copyright typically does not prohibit fair uses of an author's expression, such as a parody.

Trademark
A trademark is a word, slogan, symbol or design (for example, a brand name or logo) that distinguishes the products or services offered by one person from another. Generally, trademark law seeks to prevent confusion among consumers about the source of a product or service. But using a trademark for the purpose of discussing the goods offered, such as to criticize them, does not typically constitute infringement.

Counterfeits
A counterfeit good is a knock-off or replica version of another company's product. It usually copies the trademarked name, logo, and/or distinctive features of that other company's product to imitate a genuine product. Manufacture, promotion, or sale of counterfeits is a type of trademark infringement.
